# stretch
a program to quit computer-occupied
when you want to stop looking at the screen but cannot control yourself,
use the computer that can run this program,don't use devices that cannot .
imagine the screen can be streched bigger like a piece of cloth, 
consisted of red,green,blue lighthat(only two states,on or off),
and open this program.
it can make that happen on your screen.
if you feel the screen is too dumb to look at, then that is it.
